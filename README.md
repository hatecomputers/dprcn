dpcrn aka dope recon is a module-oriented recon tool.

## Why another recon tool

This started as a _refactor_ of my existing [recon-all-things]() script, which was cluttered and unexplicably unflexible. In the process of learning new things and / or having new ideas, I wanted something easy so I could quickly introduce new workflows or modifying the ones which are no longer useful. So this makes things a little more managable. Think of it as an orchestrator, if you will.

This was solely created for personal usage. Moreover, I like writing my own tools and adapt it to my very needs. If for whatever reason, you see value on this and decided to use it, I'm glad, but that wasn't really my initial premisse :)

## How it works 

This is a module-oriented tool, which means it relies on two things: 
* external modules 
* a config file which dictates how those modules interact with one another
